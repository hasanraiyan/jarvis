## Chat History & Context

The AI assistant now includes persistent chat history with contextual awareness:

### **Chat History Features:**
- **View History**: Click the chat icon (ðŸ’¬) to view all previous conversations
- **Auto-Save**: All user messages and AI responses are automatically saved to the database
- **Timestamps**: Each conversation includes date and time information
- **Clear History**: Option to clear all chat history when needed
- **Refresh**: Real-time updates when viewing chat history

### **Contextual AI Responses:**
- **Memory**: AI remembers previous conversations and can reference them
- **Continuity**: Conversations flow naturally with context from recent interactions
- **Personalization**: AI can remember your preferences, name, and previous topics
- **Smart Context**: Uses last 5 conversations as context (configurable)

### **Configuration:**
- **Context Limit**: Adjust how many previous conversations to include (default: 5)
- **Toggle Context**: Enable/disable contextual responses in `backend/openai_config.py`
- **Storage**: Chat history is stored in SQLite database (`jarvis.db`) and persists between sessions

**Example:** If you tell JARVIS "My name is John" in one conversation, it will remember your name in future conversations!
